                <blockquote><p>A picture is worth thousand words</p></blockquote>

                <p>
                    The images that are currently uploaded on social media sites like facebook, instagram, twitter and snapchat are all 
                    digital images. The images captured are real life objects but the images stored are actually numbers.
                    Let's take a look at how the camera does this magic and gives us a image.
                </p>

                <h2>Light</h2>

                <p>
                    Light has a dual nature of wave as well as particle. Whatever we see is just a reflection of the light incident on it.
                    For example, when we sun light falls on a tree, the tree leaves reflect only the green (or yellow or orange or pink) 
                    light incident on it and absorbs the rest of the light. Similarly the trunk will reflect brown and tones of brown light.
                    This light becomes incident on our eyes;which is focused on the retina. Due to the focal properties of the lens, the image 
                    formed on the retina is actually the inverted object of the actual object. Its the brain that takes this inverted images
                    and makes us percieve as a corect image. Camera, just like the eyes and brain, tries to do the same work for us.
                </p>

                <h2>Camera</h2>

                <p>
                    The camera uses manually adjustable lenses to capture the light incident on it, and just like the eye,
                    it focuses the image on a silicon plate (This is where all the magic begins). The light incident on the lens is focused on 
                    either a CCD or a CMOS light sensor. These plates are divided into a set of small grids, and each grid corresponds to a pixel.
                    Each pixel acts as a sensor to detect the light incident on it and measures the intensity of the incident light. Since the concept
                    of intensity has come into picture, we need to keep a check on the amount of time the light is incident on the sensor. So we need 
                    to adjust the shutter speed as well as the ISO of the image (I will explain both in a while). Now when the light of a particular
                    intensity is incident on a particular cell of a CMOS or CCD sensor for a particular time will cause photoelectric effect and cause a
                    voltage to be developed at each cell level. This voltage is the sent to a voltage amplifier. The amplifier amplifies the voltage
                    (CCD/CMOS manufactured by different companies may have different amplification ratios). These amplified signals are then converted
                    from analog to digital values using sampling and quantization(I will explain this as well).
                </p>

                <h2>Shutter and ISO</h2>

                <h3>Shutter</h3>
                <p>
                    Shutter is a smal mechanical device inside the camera that controls the amount of time the CCd or CMOS light sensors
                    are exposed to light. Where on earth is this used??
                    Simple, when u are capturing the image during day light, you may not need the exposure of lens to the light to be a long time.
                    However, during night time, when the light is less u may need the CMOS/CCD cells to be exposed for a relatively more amount of time.
                    Due to this the images can be taken during night time as well.
                </p>

                <h3>ISO</h3>
                <p>
                    ISO factor is measured in numbers. It denotes the sensitivity of light to camera. 
                    If ISO number is lowered, it means our camera is less sensitive to light and if the ISO number is high, 
                    it means it is more sensitive. The higher the ISO setting is, the brighter the captured image is. The downside of increasing
                    the ISO is that it may also introduce the noise.
                </p>

                <h2>Color Images</h2>
                <p>
                    Wait a sec, since I said that the cells of light sensitive screen only captures light intensity, does that 
                    mean that the images captured are gray scaled ?
                    <br>
                    <b>No</b>
                    <br>
                    There is a layer of filter above each cell of the light sensitive sheet. This filter absorbs only light belonging 
                    to a particular color. The image shown below shows that how the light color filter screen. As one can see that the light sensors 
                    absorb light only that pass through these filters. Based on the image show, one can see that the number of green light filter are double then either
                    of the red or blue light filter. This is due to the fact that our eyes are more susciptible to green than to blue or red. A colored image can be only formed 
                    from the combination of all the three primary colors. Hence the manipulation done by the camera producers is done at this stage.
                    The assumption is that two pixel, who are very close to each other can be assumed to have similar values of Red or Blue or Green. So the 
                    manufaturers manipulate the pixel values at each point by taking the average of the neighbouring colors.

                <h2>Digitzation of the image</h2>
                <p>
                    The captured images are basically voltage values, which need to be converted into discrete values inorder to be stored on a chip.
                    This process is done by quantization and sampling. The image below shows the graph of a continuous function which need to be quantized
                    as well as sampled.
                </p>
                <figure style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;display: block;width: 50%">
                    <img src="images/blog-images/capturing-of-digital-image/quantization-level-and-sampling.jpg" alt="" style="align-content: center">
                    <figcaption>Image Credit : Tutorials Point</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <h3>Sampling</h3>
                <p>
                    During Sampling, we consider some values on x-axis after particular interval. The corresponding y-axis values are stored. We need to 
                    sample the function in such a way that enough amount of samples are there so that an image can be generated. The sample selection frequency 
                    is taken in mind considering the Nyquist frequency for sampling.
                </p>
                <h3>Quantization</h3>
                <p>
                    Now when these samples are stored they are real values and hence require a lot of space to be stored. So we quantize them into a particular
                    range based on the number of bits used to store per pixel(bpp). So lets say that our device stores the per pixel of an image in 8 bits. This means
                    that we can make devision on the y-axis which would be equal to 2^bpp = 2^8 = 256. This means that we have devided the input range of continuous values
                    into a range of 0-255 eacch of equal width.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is how an image is converted from analog values to digital values. Gray images are stored with only one channel where the channel 
                    directly represents the quantized values of the input light. However, in case of colored images, the number channels is 3 and one channel
                    represents red, one blue and one green. This digital images can be then used for digital image processing function nd for many other tasks.

                    I am Computer Engineering student studying from Sardar Patel Institute of Technology. 
                    I have quite a lot of hobbies and these mainly include reading books probably thrillers, autobiograhies and philosophical.
                    I even enjoy going on treks, both long and short. I have shown some of my images on the carrousal of the blog. In this blog post I would be sharing my work on image processing and Computer Vision.
                    If I am able to find time, I would even like to share some information about Machine Learning, Deep learning as well as some of my trekking
                    experiences.
